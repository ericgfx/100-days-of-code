# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 1, 2019 Monday
##### Plan: Create web-version of HomeCook: Recipe Finder App

**Today's Progress:** First day. Bit of a mess, just because I want to put in my one-hour of code but in reality I want to plan and think exactly what do I want this thing to do. Clearly I can't build it first and then think about it. Well first thing first I'll sketched up a loose idea for a Minimum Viable Product. https://github.com/ericgfx/100-days-of-code/blob/master/HomeCookWeb/Mockup.pdf and decided against using a uicookies template.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with deciding what to do and how to do it. Other than that, off to a good start. I found NodeSchool Oakland, and will try to link up with them to build a community for those times I get stuck. I know the MongoDB is recommended for Javascript, and I believe React is the framework for interfacing with it. Ah yes much to learn there is.
I may need to do a few free code camp courses for html and css refreshing.


### Day 1: July 2
##### The struggle is real.

**Today's Progress:** Okay so just jumping in based on my mockup. Started with a basic html outline with a linked css. Total basics. Grabbed a bunch from w3Schools for that header part.

**Thoughts:** Started by looking at the code from a codecademy file, but realize my version of it atleast, had used bootstrap. And just looking at that got me wanting to learn flexbox. None of this xs-col-11 thankyou very much. But then I wonder okay how will flexbox deal with background imagery? Something to look at tomorrow perhaps. 


### Day 2: July 4
##### Took a day away for Charlie to experience biolumenscence at Tomales Bay. Silly sit on top kayak with holes in it? Water was cold, and 2ft breaking waves!

**Today's Progress:** Why not try to learn a bit of flexbox? I was having some issues with the heights not being as tall as my avatar.

**Thoughts:** Seems like everything has its own unique way of failing. Just building a clever nav bar seems difficult. Taking a nap before my head sounds like these fireworks.

### Day 3: July 5
##### Looking better

**Today's Progress:** Used Adobe Color to explore different color palettes for something with a bit more charm than grey on grey. Also added new image from unsplash.

**Thoughts:**Wow so not a coding language. HTML and CSS is like the wild west in that there are so many different ways to achieve a look. I've been using CSS Tricks to cudgle a look together, wether its :placeholder to style *that* bit of code. Feels like my CSS is already super bloated, and all I have are a Nav and a Welcome Section. Feels ugly.
