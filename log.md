# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 1, 2019 Monday
##### Plan: Create web-version of HomeCook: Recipe Finder App

**Today's Progress:** First day. Bit of a mess, just because I want to put in my one-hour of code but in reality I want to plan and think exactly what do I want this thing to do. Clearly I can't build it first and then think about it. Well first thing first I'll sketched up a loose idea for a Minimum Viable Product. https://github.com/ericgfx/100-days-of-code/blob/master/HomeCookWeb/Mockup.pdf and decided against using a uicookies template.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with deciding what to do and how to do it. Other than that, off to a good start. I found NodeSchool Oakland, and will try to link up with them to build a community for those times I get stuck. I know the MongoDB is recommended for Javascript, and I believe React is the framework for interfacing with it. Ah yes much to learn there is.
I may need to do a few free code camp courses for html and css refreshing.


### Day 1: July 2
##### The struggle is real.

**Today's Progress:** Okay so just jumping in based on my mockup. Started with a basic html outline with a linked css. Total basics. Grabbed a bunch from w3Schools for that header part.

**Thoughts:** Started by looking at the code from a codecademy file, but realize my version of it atleast, had used bootstrap. And just looking at that got me wanting to learn flexbox. None of this xs-col-11 thankyou very much. But then I wonder okay how will flexbox deal with background imagery? Something to look at tomorrow perhaps.
