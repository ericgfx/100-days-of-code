# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 1, 2019 Monday
##### Plan: Create web-version of HomeCook: Recipe Finder App

**Today's Progress**: First day. Bit of a mess, just because I want to put in my one-hour of code but in reality I want to plan and think exactly what do I want this thing to do. Clearly I can't build it first and then think about it. Well first thing first I'll sketch a loose idea for a Minimum Viable Product. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with deciding what to do and how to do it. Other than that, off to a good start. I found NodeSchool Oakland, and will try to link up with them to build a community for those times I get stuck. I know the MongoDB is recommended for Javascript, and I believe React is the framework for interfacing with it. Ah yes much to learn there is.
I may need to do a few free code camp courses for html and css refreshing.
