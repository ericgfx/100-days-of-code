# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Eric Gross

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 1, Monday, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started working on the HomeCook Front End Development. Cloned the github repository.
Created a basic wireframe to help me plan and think. 

##Thoughts## This might be a little more challenging than I thought. Was going to use one of the free html templates from bootstrap and uicookies, but kind of see that as a cop-out and a way to more frustration. While it may not look as cool, I want to make it simple and work.
